His era leaves a memory that still lingers on."

His legacy, both black and gold."

Politics and power, in a complex maze.
An ambitious leader, with a dubious fate,

And ended Vietnam's war, a triumph celebrate.
A tarnished legacy, both love and hate,
Richard Nixon, a figure of constant debate."

In the political arena, had much to learn.
Watergate scandal, his reputation did smite,

In the Oval Office, shone a dimmed light.

A blend of triumph and affliction,
Such is the tale of President Nixon."

And brought the Vietnam War to its knees.
Yet, his legacy, forever mixed in friction,
Such is the tale of President Richard Nixon."
